It is our goal to divert as much furniture away from the landfills as possible! However, in some cases when furniture is not in re-use condition, or we cannot find a facility to accept the furniture for donation, we breakdown the furniture and recycle it at our facility. We generally can recycle up to 95% of the materials reducing the waste that ends up in the landfill.</li>

                            Good packing is essential for a stress-free move. If you choose to do some or all of your own packing, it is important that you be familiar with professional packing techniques in order to help protect your possessions.

                        <p>
                            Stoves or ranges are easily damaged in a move due to their utility connections, glass or ceramic tops, intricate parts and polished finishes. The safest way to move your stove is to first give it a thorough cleaning well before your move date.

                            Many large appliances have gas or high-voltage electrical connections that require the attention of a qualified technician. It may be best to have such a specialist assist with your dishwasher’s preparation for transport.

                            Moving your household plants could be more difficult than you might expect. Plants are categorized as “perishable” items under federal guidelines. Because they are perishable, federal law does not allow them to be transported by regulated moving vans for distances greater than 150 miles, or on trips greater than 24 hours in duration.
