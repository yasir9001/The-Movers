                        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                        <p>
                            It all started as an after-school business for a group of university mates to earn some money for their expenses. 
                            With a hand-drawn logo, advertisement in a local paper, and advertising fund stashed in a ceramic dish,
                            the endeavor was never expected to be more than a local moving company.
                            
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Now, more than 30 years later, THE MOVERS® has grown both domestically and internationally with more than 380 locations worldwide.
