                        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Movers® started in the early 1980s as a way for two brothers to make extra money while they were in high school. Now, 30 years later, the company has grown to more than 350 locations worldwide.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Brothers Brig Sorber and Jon Sorber started moving people in the Lansing area using an old pickup truck. They had their mom, Mary Ellen Sheets, develop a logo to put in a weekly community newspaper. That stick-men logo still rests on every truck, sign and advertisement.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            After the brothers left for college, Sheets continued to field calls for moving services while she also worked a full-time data processing job with the State of Michigan. In 1985, she decided to make things official by purchasing a 14-foot truck for $350 and hiring a pair of movers. That $350 is the only capital Sheets has ever invested in the company.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h1>NATIONWIDE EXPANSION</h1>
                        <p>In 1989, Sheets awarded the first location outside of Michigan to her daughter, Melanie Bergeron, with an office located in Atlanta, GA.</p>
                        <p>When the company reached 39 franchises, Sheets asked Bergeron to assume the role of company president while she pursued a seat in the Michigan State Senate. Bergeron is now chair of the board. The Movers’s long track record of aggressive growth continued under Bergeron’s profession leadership and keen business strategies.</p>
                        <p>Brig and Jon Sorber eventually returned to team up with their mom and older sister in the mid-1990s. Brig Sorber now serves as co-CEO, and Jon Sorber is executive vice president. Jon Nobis also serves alongside Brig as co-CEO. Jon joined The Movers® as Chief Information Officer March 2011, took the role of Chief Operating Officer in 2013, and moved up to co-CEO in 2017.</p>
                        <p>In August 2012, former Chief Operating Officer Randy Shacka was promoted to president of The Movers®. Brant Hartle joined the executive team in 2016 as chief financial officer, and Sara Bennett was promoted from HR director to Chief Talent Officer in 2018.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                        <h1>MOVING INTO THE FUTURE</h1>
                        
                        <p>That first truck Sheets bought in 1985 has now multiplied into a fleet of more than 2,800 trucks. The Movers® is the nation's largest franchised local moving company. Customers benefit from having trained, uniformed movers who are insured and bonded to handle any home and business moving tasks.</p>
                        <p>The company has come a long way – and logged a lot of miles – since Sheets sketched the first "stick-men." The The Movers® system continues to pave the way for future growth and innovation, while remaining rooted in the core principles of exceeding customers' expectations.</p>
